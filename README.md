# DALL-E history sync

As of August 2022, OpenAI did not provide a way to back up all of the images you had generated with DALL-E. This is my attempt to provide a stop-gap measure. It downloads any new generations (since the last time you ran it) along with their prompts, timestamps, relationships to other generations, and other metadata.

**This requires familiarity with HTTP and the command line.** See sync.sh for details.

I cannot provide supportâ€”I don't work for OpenAI and don't even
have access to documentation for their website's (internal) API. It
could break at any time, or do the wrong things because I didn't make
the right guess about the parameters I was seeing in the browser's
network tab.

I cannot provide support; if you want a supported option, please ask OpenAI.

2023-02-10: I've stopped playing with DALL-E and can't commit to
testing any improvements, so I'm archiving the repo. Check the list of
recently updated forks to see if there's a maintained version:
