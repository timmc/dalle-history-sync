# DALL-E history sync

As of August 2022, OpenAI did not provide a way to back up all of the images you had generated with DALL-E. This is my attempt to provide a stop-gap measure. It downloads any new generations (since the last time you ran it) along with their prompts, timestamps, relationships to other generations, and other metadata.

**This requires familiarity with HTTP and the command line.** See sync.sh for details.

I cannot provide support; if you want a supported option, please ask OpenAI.
